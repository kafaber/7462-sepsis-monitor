Kate Faber (faber104) submission of Assignment 7. I spent quite a bit of time last weekend working on the original Assignment 7, so after the assignment was changed I spent less time than I normally would have making the graphs in the report pretty & fixing issues around NA data- hope this is OK as all the key information requested is still there.
